                            <p>Abstract— Galaxy clusters are massive objects composed of hundreds or thousands of galaxies,
                                hot gas and an extended dark matter (DM) halo. They are the largest gravitationally
                                bound structures in the Universe. As such, they result from the growth and collapse of
                                the highest peaks in the density perturbation field. Because fundamental properties of
                                the Universe determine the statistics and evolution of those peaks, clusters can be used for
                                cosmology. The most common method to do that is to use their abundance, which requires
                                counting them in bins of mass and redshift (distance). But this has the disadvantage of
                                not distinguishing between high peaks early, or large growth which would result in similar
                                number of observed clusters today. However, in the first scenario clusters would form
                                earlier than in the latter.
                                I used analytical models to predict exactly how cluster age varies with cosmology, and
                                then tested the results by analysing simulation data from different sources.

                            <p>Abstract— Because clusters form in bottom-up hierarchical way through mergers to larger
                                structures, properties of their internal structures are related to their growth history.
                                Young clusters will have more substructure in them, be less concentrated, have non-spherical
                                shapes and less relaxed. This allows to estimate their age by looking at how they look.
                                I studied how different structural properties relate a variety of age indicators through
                                a Principal Component Analysis on different age and structural properties calculated in
                                a simulation I have run. I have found that concentration and the offset between the centre
                                of mass and the point of highest density can predict cluster age with good accuracy.

                            <p>Abstract— Since cluster age depends on cosmology and cluster age produces different
                                internal structures, we can expect that we can constrain cosmological parameters,
                                specifically &Omega;<sub>m</sub>-the amount of matter in the Universe- and
                                &sigma;<sub>8</sub>-how clumpy the matter distribution in the Universe is.
                                I ran a set of 25 High-Resolution N-body cosmological simulations, producing more than
                            100Tb of data, each with different cosmological parameters. I found that the centre of mass
                            offset, shape and concentration are sensitive to <p>&Omega;<sub>m</sub></p> and
                            <p>&sigma;<sub>8</sub></p> and can be used to constrain cosmology.

                            <p>Abstract— The Euclid space telescope is a European Space Agency (ESA) mission whose aim
                                is to help understand the mysteries of Dark Matter and Dark Energy by looking at structures
                                of the Universe and generating a 3D map of the structures within it. Among the structures
                                Euclid will detect are Clusters of Galaxies, the largest gravitaionally bound objects in
                                the Universe. In order to be ready to use the data the telescope will provide, tests using
                            synthetic data are performed. My role was to use those simulations to measure the density
                            profiles of galaxy clusters and compare them to an ideal case to assess of the accuracy of
                            those measurements. This involved collecting and cleaning simulation data, finding the best
                            model parameters for the density of profile of each cluster using a Maximum Likelihood
                            estimator and minimisation routine in Python, as well as statistical tests such as
                            the KS test.
                            My tests lead to the discovery of faulty simulation data, which were subsequently removed,
                            saving mistakes from all subsequent tests that would have used that simulation.</p>

                            <p>Abstract— Little is known about the particle nature of Dark Matter, but the most common
                            model is a Weakly Interactive Massive Particle (WIMP) that is not subject to the
                                electromagnetic interaction. However, two WIMP particles can interact with each other
                            and the resulting particles would emit radiation, that we can in theory detect. Because dark
                            matter represents the skeleton of the structures of the Universe, dark matter clumps, called
                            halos and subhalos, surround our galaxy and are typically also the host of smaller
                            galaxies, called satellite galaxies. If dark matter is indeed composed of WIMPS, we would
                            expect to detect gamma-ray emissions from the dark matter subhalos around our galaxy. These
                            would appear as gamma-ray sources. It happens that in the Fermi-LAT source catalog, there
                            are sources which are unidentified, and these are primary candidates for dark matter subhalos
                            emitting gamma-ray.
                            I studied these sources, calculating their luminosities by assigning them distances with a
                            monte carlo method. Then setting limits to WIMP particle properties given the maximum luminosity
                            calculated. </p>

                            <h6 style="line-height: 20px;">Utopia is a start-up based in Tehran and tries to address

                                A few of my friends and I got an offer to design and implement
                                a complete robust and error-free software system for this company.
                                I helped Utopia in multiple areas:
